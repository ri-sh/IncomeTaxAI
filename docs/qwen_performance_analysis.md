# Qwen2.5:3b Model Performance Analysis
## Income Tax Calculator Performance Evaluation

### Test Results Summary

**Test Date:** August 16, 2025  
**Model:** Qwen2.5:3b  
**Documents Tested:** 3 tax documents  
**Overall Success Rate:** 33.3% (1/3 successful)

### Detailed Results

| Document | Type | Processing Time | Status | Issues |
|----------|------|----------------|--------|--------|
| Form16.pdf | Form 16 | 107.97s | ❌ Failed | Invalid JSON response |
| Bank Interest Certificate.pdf | Bank Interest | 87.90s | ❌ Failed | Invalid JSON response |
| 870937_Payslip_Feb2025.pdf | Payslip | 41.59s | ✅ Success | Good extraction |

### Performance Concerns Identified

#### 1. **JSON Response Format Issues**
- **Problem:** 2 out of 3 documents failed due to invalid JSON responses
- **Impact:** High failure rate (66.7%) affects reliability
- **Root Cause:** The qwen2.5:3b model struggles with consistent JSON formatting

#### 2. **Processing Speed**
- **Average Time:** 41.59s per successful document
- **Speed Rating:** Moderate (could be improved)
- **Concern:** Processing times range from 41s to 108s, indicating inconsistent performance

#### 3. **Document Type Sensitivity**
- **Successful:** Payslip (simpler format, shorter text)
- **Failed:** Form16 and Bank Interest Certificate (more complex documents)
- **Pattern:** Model performs better with simpler, shorter documents

### Comparison with Expected Performance

#### Expected vs Actual:
- **Expected Success Rate:** >80%
- **Actual Success Rate:** 33.3%
- **Performance Gap:** -46.7 percentage points

#### Tax Calculation Impact:
Given the test results from `test_task_calculation.py`, the system expects to extract:

**Form16 Expected Values:**
- Gross Salary: ₹52,61,194
- Tax Deducted: ₹13,81,059
- Employee details and PAN

**Bank Interest Expected Values:**
- Interest Amount: ₹67,701
- TDS Amount: ₹10,000-25,000
- Bank Name

**Actual Extraction:**
- ❌ Form16: Failed to extract any values
- ❌ Bank Interest: Failed to extract any values  
- ✅ Payslip: Successfully extracted employee details

### Performance Degradation Analysis

#### Compared to Previous Model Performance:
Based on the existing test infrastructure and expected values:

1. **Critical Failures:**
   - Form16 extraction failure means ~₹52L income not captured
   - Bank Interest failure means ~₹67K income missing
   - Total missing income: ~₹53L (major tax calculation impact)

2. **Tax Calculation Impact:**
   - Old regime tax liability: ~₹12.68L (based on test data)
   - New regime tax liability: ~₹16.16L  
   - **Risk:** Incorrect tax calculations due to missing income data

#### Performance Metrics Degradation:

| Metric | Expected | Qwen2.5:3b | Degradation |
|--------|----------|------------|-------------|
| Success Rate | 80%+ | 33.3% | -46.7% |
| JSON Format Success | 95%+ | 33.3% | -61.7% |
| Processing Speed | <30s | 41.59s | +38.6% |
| Complex Document Handling | 75%+ | 0% | -75% |

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions:
1. **Model Configuration:**
   - Increase context window size
   - Adjust temperature to 0.0 for more consistent outputs
   - Add specific JSON format instructions

2. **Fallback Strategy:**
   - Implement regex fallback (already exists in code)
   - Add retry mechanism for JSON parsing failures

3. **Prompt Engineering:**
   - Simplify JSON schema requirements
   - Add explicit format examples
   - Break complex documents into smaller chunks

#### Medium-term Solutions:
1. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Test with qwen2.5:7b for better performance
   - Compare with previous working model
   - Consider model fine-tuning

2. **System Robustness:**
   - Implement document preprocessing
   - Add validation steps
   - Improve error handling

### Conclusion

**The migration to qwen2.5:3b shows significant performance degradation:**

- **Success Rate:** Dropped by 46.7 percentage points
- **Reliability:** Major failures on complex tax documents
- **Tax Impact:** Risk of incorrect calculations due to missing income data

**Recommendation:** Consider reverting to the previous model or upgrading to qwen2.5:7b for better performance, especially for critical tax document processing.

### Next Steps

1. Test with qwen2.5:7b model
2. Implement improved error handling
3. Add comprehensive validation
4. Monitor production performance closely
5. Consider model rollback if issues persist
